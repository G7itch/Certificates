        File hash and VT analysis
-----------------------------------------

- Record the common file hashes (sha256, md5 etc) 
- VT scan results (using the hashes recovered from the file)


------------------------------------------
               Basic static
------------------------------------------

- Use FLOSS for pulling out strings
- Use PE-bear and PE-studio to look at the API calls and other flagged indicators
- Good indicators will be imports, file size discrepancies, Irregular structure, etc

--------------------------------------------
    Basic dynamic/heuristic/behavioural
--------------------------------------------

- Separate indicators into 2 groups: Host indicators and Network indicators
- Make sure that all tools are setup before detonation
- Record visual observations
- Search known or suspected indicators network indicators in Wireshark
- Use something like procmon and filter for the process name or other details recovered from PE-suite to recover host indicators
- Check under multiple conditions, primarily internet on and off and look for differences in procmon - Does the malware have commands from FLOSS that only execute under a condition?
- Run multiple times to see if it performs the same each time

- You can use TCPView to look at outgoing and listening processes, and use netcat on the Remnux machine to connect and respond to them

            After basic analysis
---------------------------------------------
- Re-classify malware in standard format (type.desc.ext."mal")
